Farm moustache for fun and profit.

## About

Welcome to the `moustache` repo!

moustacherider is a script that will automatically try and steal Chester's moustache for the clan Photo Booth. The script should work regardless of your loadout.

This is a badly edited fork of <https://github.com/tigerinanenet/cognac>. Blame sepos. Or thank them, either way.

## Install

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/ziz/moustache.git release
```

## Customization

Properties you can set in KoLMafia to customize the way `moustache` runs.

### moustache_clan

Required - Set the clan in which moustache will run.

<pre>set moustache_clan = Stony's Shack</pre>

You must be whitelisted to the clan, and must have permissions to access hobopolis.

### moustache_useAsdon

Optional - Set this flag if you want `moustache` to automatically put your asdon in your workshed.

<pre>set moustache_useAsdon = true</pre>

### A day in the life

moustache will perform the following tasks to the best of its ability:

- Navigate your sewers, getting a cagebot if possible.
- Churn through your townsquare (Assumes you're already buffed up to overkill). Stops after Purple Light District is unlocked.
- Churn through the PLD, flimflamming and starting fights, until Chester is available.
- Stop, so you can go steal Chester's moustache.

### How to make moustache sad

moustache will never be sad. if you think moustache is sad, it is probably that you are sad instead. have you considered doing something else with your one wild and precious life? apricot trees exist. You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.
